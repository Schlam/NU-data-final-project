# Final Project

The outline for this project should roughly follow 

## EDA

Initial loading/inspection of data, a few simple visualizations/statistical tests

## Data cleaning

This is a shorter portion than the following *preparation* section 

- Fixing corrupted/misformatted data
- Filling/dropping missing values

## Data preparation

This is mainly mathematical, transforming/encoding features as necessary

### Feature selection/engineering

A possible subcategory

## Modeling

This contains the ML portion of this project

### Model Selection

What kind of ML problem is this? What model is best suited for the task?

### Model assessment

See how well the model performs the intended task

- Statistical analyses
- Visual report

### Hyperparameter tuning

Once a good model is chosen, find the optimal parameters

## Analyze Results

This is where Tableau might fit best, make a story summarizing the
process and explain the narrative that ties together all the components
